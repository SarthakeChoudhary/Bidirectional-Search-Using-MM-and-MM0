# Implementation of Bi-directional Search using MM, MM0 in Pac-Man Domain

We have implemented a Bi-diretional Serach using MM and MM0 algorithm for a Pac-Man Domain which is guaranteed to meet in the middle. We are also provinding a comparative analysis of this algorithm with that of A* search. The algorithm is tested for different range of complexity(obstacles encountered by the Pac-Man) namely for 0%,30% and 50% respectively.


The pseudocode is inspired from the paper “Bidirectional Search That Is Guaranteed to Meet in the Middle”, Robert C. Holte, Ariel Felner, Guni Sharon, Nathan R. Sturtevant, AAAI 2016.


# What you will need to run this:

Python 2 

# How to run:
Navigate to to the search folder and enter the following commands:
The code can be tested for different maze size namely: tiny, medium and big
## To check the results for 0% complexity:

*To run A*, 
*To run MM0,
*To run MM,

## To check the results for 30% complexity:

To run A*,
To run MM0,
To run MM,

## To check the results for 50% complexity:

To run A*,
To run MM0,
To run MM,
